          <h5><a target=_blank href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko_Tao">Koh Tao</a> the tiny island 
            also known as Turtle Island, 45 km north of Koh Phangan, is one of the top scuba diving<br/>destinations in Thailand
          </h5>
          <h5>The island, which is the site of important breeding grounds for Hawksbill and Green turtles, is now a centre for<br/>environmentally 
             friendly diving practices, including the reintroduction of hundreds of juvenile turtles to the island's<br/>ecosystem and efforts to 
             preserve and grow coral reefs.
